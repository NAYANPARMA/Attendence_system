# Attendence_system
This is the project of Auto attendence system using face recognition.
To train a model a run the file Attendence_system.ipynb

link for the  extrected faces  from the dataset https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ll3X7slF4rq1bWUWVcbnoM3GDu6Pu7Zh?usp=sharing

link for the trained model file https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGlUHEAtVaCH2Iqb1F4VNLYjiErgzSb2/view?usp=sharing 

you need to download the dataset in oreder to train these model.

In this project I trined a model to recognize a person from their passport images and selfie images to take a attendece. I used a keras InceptionaResnetV2 model and triplet loss function to traina model.

In gui.py need to upload two images one is passport imae and second is selfie image which give a face detected images and also show a confidence valuse betwwen two images.

Thank you.
