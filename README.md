link for the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/jayitabhattacharyya/face-match

you need to download the dataset in oreder to train these model.

In this project I trined a model to recognize a person from their passport images and selfie images to take a attendece. I used a keras InceptionaResnetV2 model and triplet loss function to traina model.

In gui.py need to upload two images one is passport imae and second is selfie image which give a face detected images and also show a confidence valuse betwwen two images.

Thank you.
